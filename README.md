Object detection is a branch of Computer Vision, in which visually observable objects that are in images of videos can be detected, localized, and recognized by computers. An image is a single frame that captures a single-static instance of a naturally occurring event . On the other hand, a video contains many instances of static images displayed in one second, inducing the effect of viewing a naturally occurring event.

A Python library called ImageAI

Install on your computer is Python 3.

pip3 install the following dependencies:

i. 		TensorFlow (tensorflow)
ii. 	Numpy (numpy)
iii.	SciPy (scipy)
iv. 	OpenCV (opencv-python)
v. 		Pillow (pillow)
vi. 	Matplotlib (matplotlib)
vii. 	H5py (h5py)
viii. 	Keras (keras)
ix. 	ImageAI (https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/2.0.2/imageai-2.0.2-py3-none-any.whl )


We usu trained YOLOv3 computer vision model to perform the detection and recognition tasks
